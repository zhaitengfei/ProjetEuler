/**
 * Problem 6 Sum square difference 
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten
 * natural numbers is,
 * 
 * 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural
 * numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the
 * squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’
 * 385 = 2640.
 * 
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
 * natural numbers and the square of the sum.
